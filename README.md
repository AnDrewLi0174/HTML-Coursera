# Several commands to remember:(Git section, Lecture 3 of the Course)
git add . (marks all files within the directory to be committed) 

git commit -m "txt" (commit the changes with text describing the commit)


git push (push all local commits to Github)

browser-sync start --server --directory --files "*" (instant refresh as local http host, no delays, good for debugging)

## HTML Grammar:
HTML is structure-only language, the only HTML parts are the tags that surround the content.

Tags usually consist of opening and closing tags ("<br>" and "<hr>" have no closing tags) that are pairwise definitive: "<p>" &amp;  "</p>"

"<p/>" are self-closing tags (but still considered as opening tags) and they surround no content.

we may define attributes within the opening tag like this : "<p id="MyId"> </p>"
